Engineer
---------------------------
• Alternate names: E4, L4, SDE 2, IC 2 
• Experience Range: 2-5 years

The Engineer Level is a large band that ranges from highly productive new grads with a year’s worth of experience, to people with 4 years of experience who have shipped significant products.
The theme for this level is high individual productivity. You ship large projects and features, but don’t yet own responsibility for your team’s outcomes.

Technical Expectations
---------------------------
You can own large features, which can require more than a month or so of work. You are able to break up the project into many tasks, and complete them with little guidance.

You are highly effective as a coder. You consistently write code that’s cohesive and maintenable. You proactively own and fix the codebase, whether it’s upgrading to modern frameworks, adding tests, or refactoring confusing pieces. You demonstrate high throughput – within your team, and perhaps the org, you may have one of the highest number of commits or the highest number of features shipped.

People Expectations
---------------------------
You give great code reviews to peers and junior engineers. You are a great mentor on the craft of engineering. You have learned how the organization works – from how products get shipped, to what to do if something breaks. You know how to work well with PMs, managers, and tech leads. You can use that knowledge to join any large initiative and produce quickly. People are often very thankful when you join a project.
